I had some setbacks with the GameOfLife project and I spent a great deal of time debugging that I didn't record.
I hope that the following explanation helps justify that choice, and that my videos before and after this are adequate
for getting course credit. I most definitely put the hours in to complete it.

- Snark Loop failing test was due to human error in copying the rle text for the 2nd generation (Yeah, I'm dumb)
- Added extra tests for lobster shape to debug UI. Was also human error... no bug in UI.
- built a minimal UI in React to help debug. Did not record since UI testing isn't covered in course.

The repo may look like a lot changed at once, but very little (if anything) changed in the core project files
built with TDD. A few imports changed from moving large example arrays and strings to separate files, etc.

I spent hours debugging the code to narrow down the problems. I figured no one wanted to see that, and recording it
would have slowed it down. Not to mention increased anxiety from the feeling of someone watching...

Copying and pasting the 2nd generation of the Lobster shape again for the expected value in the test fixed it.
I really don't know how I ended up with the wrong value the first time around. No code was changed to make it pass.
