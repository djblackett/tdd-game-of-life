# Game Of Life

## Description

Conway's Game of Life implemented as a program that reads am RLE file, computes and outputs the results of the specified 
generations also in RLE format. 

A basic web interface was created for testing purposes, but it's not the goal of this project. 

This project was completed as a final assignment for University of Helsinki's course Test-Driven Development (https://tdd.mooc.fi/)

## How to run

Run program with `npm start` followed by arguments for `filepath` and `number_of_generations`   

For example:  
`npm start test/rle-files/gosper-gun.rle 3`

The test folder contains a subfolder `rle-files`, which contains a few rle files for your convenience. 
The program doesn't modify the input files.
